Tutorial MJOLNIR using demultiplexed raw data - BATS

In this example, we will run MJOLNIR with a set of fastq files, each containing an individual sample (already demultiplexed by Illumina using library tags).

For this tutorial you will need the following files:

1. RAW SEQUENCING DATA

We have ten paired-end fastq files for ten bats poop samples, taken after the Great Annual Transylvania Party Dinner. 
Those files have been already demultiplexed by the Illumina sequencer. The file names can have whatever format. But they must have a common format for the R1 and R2 motifs (e.g. "_R1." and "_R2.".

- Bartok_R1.fastq & Bartok_R2.fastq
- Von_Count_R1.fastq & Von_Count_R2.fastq
- Duckula_R1.fastq & Duckula_R2.fastq
- Anishinabe_R1.fastq & Anishinabe_R2.fastq
- Camazotz_R1.fastq & Camazotz_R2.fastq
- Chocula_R1.fastq & Chocula_R2.fastq
- Orlok_R1.fastq & Orlok_R2.fastq
- Vampirella_R1.fastq & Vampirella_R2.fastq
- Whiskers_R1.fastq & Whiskers_R2.fastq
- Barnabas_R1.fastq & Barnabas_R2.fastq

2. THE METADATA FILE

When we have demultiplexed sample files, we do not need to use a ngsfilter table file (as we do for multiplexed Metafast libraries). But we need to provide the sample information in the metadata file. We have to create a column called "fastq_name_R1" with the names of the R1 fastq files for each sample, along with their "mjolnir_agnomens" and "original_samples" columns.
The metadata is a TSV file (using tab separators("\t") as separator character. It must contain at least the mentioned three columns. Note that you need to provide agnomens with the format LIBX_sample_XXX, where LIBX must match the lib attribute given to the MJOLNIR R functions.
RAGNAROC will also use this information to recover the original names from the "original_samples" column for the final dataset.
The rest of the metadata columns are optional. You can include any metadata describing your set of sample. 

3. TAXONOMIC INFORMATION

In addition, for the taxonomic assignment step using THOR, we will need a directory containing all the taxonomic information needed. You will need:
- A reference database for your metabarcoding fragment in fasta format.
- A taxonomy database in ecoPCR-db format.
- The three tables needed for assignment of higher ranks: order_complete.csv, family_to_order.csv, and genus_to_family.csv.
See our DUFA repositories here: https://github.com/uit-metabarcoding/DUFA/tree/master/DUFA_COLR for more information.

4. THE MJOLNIR PIPELINE

This is an R script file, called mjolnir_BATS.R in our example.

The main difference with the multiplexed library is that you do not need to call RAN. You can start directly with FREYJA, using the option "demultiplexed=TRUE". 
FREYJA will look for the fastq R1 names in the LIBX_metadata.csv file.
The information for the R1 and R2 motifs and the sequences of the primers need to be passed as options to FREYJA. The Leray-XT primer sequences do not need to be passed, since they are the default option.
